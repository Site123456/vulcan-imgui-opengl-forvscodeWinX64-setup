## 📘 Documentation

- Docs: https://corsprite-docs.vercel.app/  
- Dev updates: https://www.youtube.com/@CORSPRITE

**Built with**
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

---

## 🧠 Vision

CORSPRITE aims to deliver a **local, fast, GPU‑accelerated assistant** with:

- native system feel  
- minimal latency  
- full Unicode support  
- customizable UI (min size: 620×700)  
- multi‑language architecture  

---

## 🧱 Architecture

| Layer | Language | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| UI Renderer | C++ | ImGui + GPU rendering |
| Logic Layer | Python | AI interaction & scripting |
| System Bridge | Rust | OS access + performance |

---

## 🔧 Requirements

Install before building:

- Vulkan SDK  
- GLFW  
- MinGW‑w64 / GCC 11+ (MSVC planned)

Check compiler:
```bash
g++ --version
```

Build:
```bash
make
```

---

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Site123456/CORSPRITE.git
cd CORSPRITE
make
```

Run:
```bash
Corsprite_luncher.exe
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Updates

Active work includes:

- securing Python ↔ Rust communication  
- fixing auto installation for python directly from c++
- bridge connection between Rust & C++
- Audio to Text
- Corsprite VD
- sandboxing external inputs  
- validating assistant commands  

Note: Python & Rust files will be uploaded only after fix
---

## 🔊 Audio Auto‑Detection

CORSPRITE includes an **automatic audio device detection system** designed to make voice interaction seamless and reliable across different hardware setups.

### What the system does
- Detects available **microphones** at launch  
- Monitors **device changes** in real time (USB plug/unplug, Bluetooth connect/disconnect)  
- Automatically switches to the **active / highest‑priority** input device  
- Prevents audio dropouts when devices are added or removed  
- Ensures the assistant is always ready to listen without manual configuration  

### How it works internally
- Uses a lightweight Rust bridge for **low‑latency device enumeration**  
- Communicates with the Python logic layer for **voice activation**  
- Exposes device state to the C++ UI for **live visual feedback**  
- Supports future expansion (noise profiling, gain control, multi‑device routing)

### Current status
- Auto‑detection is **enabled in alpha builds**  
- Manual device selection UI is in development  
- Advanced audio processing (AEC, AGC, noise suppression) is planned for beta
